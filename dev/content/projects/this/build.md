## The What

> What I cannot create, I do not understand
> -- <cite>Richard Feynman</cite>

I do not understand web technologies, so I am trying to build a website. No frameworks, no templates, only tools I build myself. We're doing this raw, as our ancestors did. Within reason of course. This website is a continuous project for my self-learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and, to a small extent, the way the internet works. 

## The Why

I've always been curious about web technologies, but a combination of lack of time and some osmotically acquired prejudice (my excuse) against web development has prevented me from learning it. For some reason, I was persuaded by the notion that web development technologies such as HTML, CSS and (especially) Javascript, were some 'lesser' form of software development. Now, I still have a lack of time, but my curiosity has overcome this unfounded bias. So self-learning web development has become a procrastination effort. As I'm procrastinating doing something more useful, I do something less useful. Besides, given how much I interact with websites, I should at least understand the basics of how they work. 

## The How 

There are countless online resources for learning. So much so, that it is a non-trivial amount of work to find the correct, let alone best, resource. Standards and tech fashions change very quickly, and finding up-to-date information can be tricky. This is doubly so for a standard like HTML and CSS, which on top of many new features, has varying levels of support from different browsers. This was interesting to me -- that these standards evolve in such a decentralised and browser-lead fashion, rather than through the decisions of a centralised technical committee. I may be wrong about this, but that's how it seems anyway. 

I don't have much of a structure to how I'm going about learning these things. It seemed too much effort to find a reputable curriculum, so my approach is to find things that look cool and copy them. To this end, YouTube channels like [Kevin's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) and sites like [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) are fantastic. It's the 'copy-without-paste' method. I used to do something like this, but for generic text, when I wanted to learn touch typing. And there is something to be said about the muscle-familiarity of typing a new language. Those semicolons and curly braces are a workout.

## The End

It will be fun to see where this goes.
