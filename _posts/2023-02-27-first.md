So, another blog. The more times I start one, the better I get at starting a blog. Surely. 
My tennis coach always scolded me for my lack of follow through, but at least he couldn't fault my initiative. 
Let's hope this one is different. 

Things I want to cover: 
- general musings; 
- small and large projects; 
- summaries or reviews of things I come across which require judgement;
- interesting thoughts; 
- uninteresting thoughts.

A few things I want from this endeavour: 
- form a habitual writing exercise, so that I don't degenerate into illiteracy; 
- persist some thoughts in an archive, so that I can cringefully reflect from time to time; 
- solidify random things I learn.

This is entirely self-serving (for now), which may or may not mean non-committal since there are no expectations. 
I don't want to commit on that.
