In the continual struggle against the distractions of the internet, procrasticleaning -- cleaning as a form of procrastination -- is a useful tool. 
The obvious benefit is being able to incrementally complete recurrent chores. 
I also find I'm also not as disgusted with myself for putting off some higher priority task, compared to regular procrastination. 
Of course, there is only so much cleaning one can do before the sterility becomes overbearing, but this limit is practically academic for now. 
So, from now, whenever I feel the rip tide of YouTube's recommendations dragging me out to sea, I shall grab my vacuum. 
Other distraction techniques to try in the future: procrastibaking, procrastibating, procrastishaking.
